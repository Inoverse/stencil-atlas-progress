# Stencil Atlas Progress Demo

I've migrated my 3 years old Ionic v1 component [ionic-atlas-prgoress](https://github.com/WebAtlas/ionic-atlas-progress) to the [StencilJS](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil). Stencil is a compiler/transpiler to build native web components which can be used in every framework and/or with vanilla JS.

*Stencil is currently in alpha*

For functions see original repository: [Ionic-Atlas-Progress](https://github.com/WebAtlas/ionic-atlas-progress).
